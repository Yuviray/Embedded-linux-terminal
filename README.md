# **Embedded-linux-terminal**
**- Yuvanesh Rajamani, Collan Parker**
## Project Description:
For many beginners, Linux can pose an intimidating set of challenges. At first, many of the
specifics of the language are unintuitive. While all terminal emulators offer the resources to learn
and practice with the most important aspects of Linux (as this is a built-in feature of the
language), most terminals take a minimalist approach when it comes to the GUI. This approach
isn’t necessarily wrong but could result in limiting some users’ ability to succeed while using the
terminal. This application is designed to be a tool for new users to better learn the fundamentals of
Linux/Unix commands, and for experienced users to increase their productivity while working
within a Unix environment. This application is intended to be used as a tool to help beginners learn how to work with Linux.
In addition to this, the application will be able to fast track some processes and increase overall
efficiency for all users.
